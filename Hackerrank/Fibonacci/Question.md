#The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence appears in nature all around us, in the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower and the spiral of a nautilus for example.

The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1 as its first and second terms. After these first two elements, each subsequent element is equal to the sum of the previous two elements.


Example
n=5

The Fibonacci sequence to 6 is [0,1,1,2,5,8] .
